# Problem 2
Try loading a different food web and find the modules.

# Problem 5
Try to calculate modularity for the binary version of this web. How do the
results differ?

# Problem 6
Can you project the network and calculate modularity in each of the
projections? Do plants that cluster together in the projection also cluster
together in the bipartite version? Is there an difference in the ecological
interpretation between these two scenarios?

# Problem 7
Find another data set that interests you personally in which you could
hypothesize the existence of communities. Explain why this hypothesis is
relevant for this data set. Analyze for communities. Do the results support the
hypothesis (e.g., when you examine the nodes in each module).
