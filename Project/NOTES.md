DyerNason2004:

 - Generate N population centroids corresponding to original populations
 - Calculate pairwise distances between centroids (Saturated Population Graph)
 - Convert to precision matrix
 - Use edge-exclusion deviance to prune conditionally independent populations (precision entry is 0)


Garrowayetal2008:


genepi:

 - Combine spectral graph theory with multidimensional scaling.
 - PCA alone has problems:
   - substructure can get swamped out by noise
   - outliers can fuck you up
