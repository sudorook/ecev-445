# Problem 1
*The matrix in this section is not stable. How can you make it stable? Show.*


# Problem 2
*Given a matrix with `S=250` and a self-regulation value of `-1.5`, what is the
necessary variance of the interactions to make it stable? Show analytically and
computationally.*


# Problem 3
*How does the probability of stability depend on the number of species? Why? Try
to increase the number of species.*


# Problem 4
*Try to examine the role of the mean for a different distribution than uniform
(line `M <- matrix(runif(S^2, min = -sqrt(3), max = sqrt(3)), S, S)`).*


# Problem 5
*What do you notice about the effect of modularity vs. anti-modularity on the
outlier eigenvalues?*
